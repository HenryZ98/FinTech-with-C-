For this assignment, you will practice black box testing skils. 

First a question: How many days are there between January 1 and March
31? If you answered 'It depends,' you are on the right track. Getting
this correct would be important for, say, calculating interest
compounded daily. 

Tasks

1.  Investigate the leap year rules for the Gregorian calendar.

2.  Create test cases to comprehensively test the rules. Write each
    test case as a line containing a four digit year (e.g. '2020'),
    the expected test result ('true', 'false',) and a sentence
    explaining your rationale for the test case.  

All test cases should follow this format: 

year, expected; rationale.

Here is one example test case:

1997, false; Odd years are not leap years. 

Create your list of test cases, one per line, in a file 'tests.txt'.

3.  Once you have developed your test cases and the reasoning behind
    each test case, run 'run_all.sh', which will apply your test cases
    to a set of correct leap year implementation. A complete and
    correct set of test cases will pass.
    
4.  You will submit 'tests.txt' for this assignment.
