In this assignment, you are going to fix a broken program that creates
some arrays of points and does arithmatic on them.

This program, which is is included in vg_err.c, takes one command line
argument, the number of points in the array makes a variety of
errors--all of which valgrind will detect. Your job for this problem
is to fix the program by making it valgrind cleanly.

You could run the program (for example) with the argument:

  valgrind ./vg_err 3

Note: If you compile with debugging symbols (-ggdb3), valgrind will
also provide line numbers.

Hint: Start from the first valgrind error. Read and understand the
      error. It will tell you on what line of code valgrind detected
      the problem. To understand the error and why it is occuring,
      drawing some pictures will likely help. Fix the error,
      re-compile, and re-run. Repeat the process until all valgrind
      errors are gone. Don't forget that gdb may be useful as well.
