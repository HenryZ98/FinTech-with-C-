For this assignment, you are going to write the program
"cmp_doubles". This program takes 4 command line arguments. The first
two are doubles to be compared to each other (called num1 and num2 in
the rest of this README). The third is the tolerance type, which is
one of the following words: 

  abs
  pct1
  pct2

which describe how to interpret the 4th parameter (as explained
below). The fourth parameter is also a double, and is the tolerance
within which the first two numbers are considered equal to each
other. 

If the wrong number of parameters are given, any of the numeric
arguments cannot be parsed as doubles (by strtod), or the third
parameter is not one of the words above, the program should print a
meaningful error message and exit with a failure status.

This tolerance is interpeted in one of three ways based on the third
parameter as follows: 

  abs:  the tolerance is absolute, and the numbers are considered
        equal if (and only if) num2 is in the range
	[num1 - tolerance, num1 + tolerance] 
  pct1: the tolerance is considered a percentage of num1, and the
        numbers are considered equal if (and only if) num2 is in the
        range 
	[num1 - num1 * tolerance/100, num1 + num1 * tolerance/100]
  pct2: the tolerance is considered a percentage of num2, and the
        numbers are considered equal if (and only if) num1 is in the
        range 
	[num2 - num2 * tolerance/100, num2 + num2 * tolerance/100]

The program should print a single line with one of the following
words:

less
equal
greater

It should print "equal" whenever the numbers are considered equal
within the specified tolerance as described above. It should print
"less" whenever num1 is "less" than num2 (and not within the tolerance
of equality) and "greater" otherwise.

For example

./cmp_doubles 100 101 abs 1

would print "equal" as 100 and 101 are considered equal within a tolerance
of 1. However,

./cmp_doubles 100 101 abs 0.5

would print "less" as the numbers are not within an absolute tolerance
of 0.5, and 100 < 101.

Likewise

./cmp_doubles 200 204 pct1 2

would print "equal" as pct1 makes the tolerance 2% of the first
number, so anything in the range 196 to 204 is treated as equal.

You should create a source file called cmp_doubles.c. We have provided
a Makefile that builds it into the binary cmp_doubles.
