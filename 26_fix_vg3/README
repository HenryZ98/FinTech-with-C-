In this assignment, you are going to fix a broken program that does
part of the minesweeper assignment from your Coursera work. It reads
the board width, height, and number of mines as command line
arguments, makes a board, adds mines, then deallocates the board's
memory.

This program, which is is included in vg_err.c makes a variety of
errors--all of which valgrind will detect. Your job for this problem
is to fix the program by making it valgrind cleanly. 

You could run the program (for example):

  valgrind ./vg_err 2 3 2

Note: If you compile with debugging symbols (-ggdb3), valgrind will
also provide line numbers.

Hint: Start from the first valgrind error. Read and understand the
      error. It will tell you on what line of code valgrind detected
      the problem. To understand the error and why it is occuring,
      drawing some pictures will likely help. Fix the error,
      re-compile, and re-run. Repeat the process until all valgrind
      errors are gone. Don't forget that gdb may be useful as well.
