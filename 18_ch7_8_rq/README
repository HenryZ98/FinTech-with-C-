As always, read and understand Chapter 7 and Chapter 8, then answer
these questions in "answers.txt".

1.  What is memoization?

    A.  Introducing cat pictures into the algorithm
    B.  Converting between head an tail recursion
    C.  Keeping a table of previously computed values
    D.  Converting a loop into a recursive algorithm
    E.  A common typo for memorization

2.  Why do some people think recursion is slow?

    A.  Recursion is inherently slow, but computers are fast enough
        that it is not a serious hindrance.
    B.  Naive recursive algorithms duplicate significant amounts of
        work. 
    C.  The mathematical complexity is generally higher than an
        equivalent iterative solution.
    D.  Storing and retrieving the answers for each step of the
        algorithm's execution is slow. 

3.  What is a base case?

    A.  The pre-specified white box test cases and their answers.
    B.  The case that you work by hand when you develop the
        algorithm. 
    C.  The inputs for which the algorithm can give an answer without
        calling itself. 
    D.  The most numerous types of inputs, which are the ones that are
        answered with reference to itself.

4.  Which of the following terms describes a pair of functions (e.g.,
    f and g) where f calls g, and g also calls f?

    A.  Mutual recursion
    B.  Tail recursion
    C.  Pairwise induction
    D.  Strong induction

5.  Which of the following is an advantage of tail recursion, compared
    to head recursion? 

    A.  It requires passing fewer parameters.
    B.  The return type of the recursive function can be void.
    C.  The recursive calls do not require the creation of additional
        frames. 
    D.  Tail recursive functions generally do not require "helper
        functions" while head recursive functions generally do require
        them. 

6.  What &x evaluate to *conceptually*?

    A.  The value in the box at the end of the arrow in x's box.
    B.  The address of x.
    C.  The contents of memory at address x.
    D.  An arrow pointing at the box for x.	

7.  For &x to be legal, what must be true of x?

    A.  x must be a constant.
    B.  x must be an rvalue.
    C.  x must be an lvalue.
    D.  x must be an int.

8.  What does dereferencing a pointer mean *conceptually*?

    A.  Releasing the memory held by a pointer.
    B.  Following the arrow to the box at its end.
    C.  Changing where the arrow points.
    D.  Getting a pointer to something.

9.  x->y is syntactic sugar for which of the following?

    A.  *(x.y)
    B.  x.*y
    C.  (*x).y
    D.  x.y**

10. What does "const int x;" mean?

    A.  x is an integer which should be constantly evaluated.
    B.  x is an integer whose value may never be changed.
    C.  x is an integer whose value is constantly changing.
    D.  None of the above
