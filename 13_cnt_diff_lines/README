For this assignment you are going to write the program
"count_diff_lines", which counts how many lines are different between
two files. This program should take two command line arguments (each
of which names a file). If the wrong number of arguments are provided,
or either names a non-existant file, the program should print an error
and exit. 

This program should read each file and print the number of lines that
are different between them. Note that this output should be one single
number and a newline. The lines should be compared directly to the
corresponding line in the other file (line 1 to line 1, line 2 to line
2, etc). Your program should NOT try to reorder the lines to find more
similarities. Your program should not assume the length of each line.

For example, if the first file (input1.txt) contains:

apple
bear
cat
dog
frog

and the second file (input2.txt) contains:

apple
cat
bear
dog
fish

the program should print:

3

as three lines are different (the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th are different).

If the files are of different lengths, then any missing line is
different than the corresponding line in the longer file. For example,
if the first file (intput1.txt) is:

apple
bear
cat
dog
frog

and the second file (intput3.txt) is:

apple
dog
frog

then the program should print

4

as lines 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not match (only apple with apple on line 1
matches).

You should profile a Makefile that compiles your program into an
executable named "count_diff_lines". For full credit on this and any
future assignments, your program must not leak memory.
